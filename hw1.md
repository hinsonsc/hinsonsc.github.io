# Homework 1: Chapter 1

        1.3:    What are the four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four
            other attributes that may sometimes be significant.

                The four attributes are: Acceptability, Dependability and security, Efficiency, Maintainability. 
                Four additional attributes of professional software could be: Scalability, Modularity, 
                Well-Documented, Independence (has few dependencies) 

        1.8:    Discuss whether professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or
            lawyers.
                
                I do not believe they should be held to the same standards as lawyers and doctors as those two 
                professions do their best to protect someone's life in drastic ways. While software engineers 
                do touch on very important aspects of peoples' lives and businesses, the vetting of engineers 
                and the team aspect of the development process allows for better protections for the business,
                 something which a patient/client may not be able to do with a doctor/lawyer. 

        1.9:    For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics shown in Figure 1.4, propose an
            appropriate example that illustrates that clause.

                1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
                        
                        e.g. SE create software that doesn't attempt to scam, exploit, or harm the users 
                        of the product (such as viruses or spyware)

                2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests 
                of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

                        e.g. SE do not attempt to undermine the client by purposely making an 
                        incomplete/faulty/malicious software that would damage the client (such as knowingly 
                        buggy or insecure software)

                3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet 
                the highest professional standards possible.

                        e.g. Software is: well documented, well written/readable where possible, and made in 
                        an effiencient manner

                4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional
                 judgment.

                        e.g. SE must be able to make reasonable judgements that advance the product in a 
                        productive way (such as cutting unneccessary features to meet deadlines)

                5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an 
                ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

                        e.g. SEM must make sure all engineers they manage follow standards of practice 
                        (such as doing code/ethics audits and training to maintain the standards)

                6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the 
                profession consistent with the public interest.

                        e.g. SE must not act in a way to degredate the reputation of the profession 
                        (such as habitually missing deadlines/delivering faulty products)

                7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

                        e.g. SE must act in a way to better the dynamic of their team/workplace by 
                        supporting their colleagues (such as giving constructive criticism, not 
                        destructive and acknowledging work of others)

                8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the 
                practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of 
                the profession.

                        e.g. SE must not become complacent in their performance and strive to better 
                        themselves and those around them (such as suggesting new training to undergo 
                        to learn new techniques/aspects of SE)

        1.10:   To help counter terrorism, many countries are planning or have developed computer 
                systems that track large numbers of their citizens and their actions. Clearly, 
                this has privacy implications. Discuss the ethics of working on the development 
                of this type of system.

                The ethics of such a system would be very hazy as the subjectivity of the importance
                of safety of the public vs the privacy of individuals is a very hard to speak of objectively.
                Both sides could use clause 1 (PUBLIC) from the ACM ethics to argue, such as the safety 
                of the general public is in the public interest vs privacy being in the public interest. 
                I believe a system would infringe on the rights of every citizen of the country providing
                very little safety in comparison to the mass loss of privacy, thus such a system would find
                itself more ethically negative than positive. I believe such a system would have to be a last 
                resort facing a very large terroristic threat, something in which most countries don't face. I 
                believe software engineers who knowingly develop this system would most likely be breaching the 
                code of ethics as they are holding the interest of the client over the public interest, thus 
                they would violate clause 1 and 6, as they would be then be harming the integrity and 
                reputation of the profession by creating such a system.
