# Welcome to my blog, it's cool (hopefully)

### Introduction

Hello! My name is Seth Hinson and I am a senior here at CofC and soon to be Cybersecurity consultant. This will be my blog documenting my journey through becoming a professional in the field I fell in love with only a few years ago. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seth-hinson-cofc/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scriptadulty) where I have a little more info about things in my past and also some (bad) memes.

I also have a dog, here's a picture of her.
