<h1>Welcome to my blog for CSCI 362!</h1>
<h3>HW0: Introduction</h3>
<p> Hello! My name is Seth Hinson and I am a senior here at CofC. I made this blog to track my work during the course of my 362 class. 
    I enjoy doing many things that involve computers, a few examples of things I do in my free time are: video games, ethical hacking, 
    building PCs, networking, and working on my personal server.
    
    I also have a dog, here's an picture of her.</p>
