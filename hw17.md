# HW17: Team Progress I

As far as the progress we've made, I feel we are pretty far ahead thanks to Robert's amazing work ethic and his willingness to help Cormac and I get familiar with javascript while not letting the team fall behind. If the project was done by this point, I would honestly ask that Robert get extra credit while taking away from my own points, but I know there is still a lot left to this process and I will be able to put in a good portion of work, although I feel it won't compare to the work Robert has done with the code while also teaching/mentoring us through learning a new language. I feel since we have a working framework, the next steps will be mainly designing the test cases and allowing Cormac and I to step in and let Robert relax for the rest of the project.
