# Homework 6: Chapter 2


 2.1: Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems. Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed:

 A system to control antilock breaking in a car
 
 This system would be best developed with the waterfall method, as it tends to be used for safety critical systems. The waterfall method would best be able to created a list of safety specs before the implementation begins, as the hardware used isn't very flexible and thus would most likely not change during development.

 A virtual reality system to support software maintenance
 
 This system would best be developed with an incremental method as this method would allow for changing hardware/customer requirements that are frequent in bleeding edge tech such as VR. Without using this process, the development could fall behind the current technology and requirements and be a year or more behind and be limited in it's usefulness.

 A university accounting system that replaces an existing system
 
 Since this system will be replacing an existing system, it would be best to use an integration and configuration process. This is the best process as it allows for the current system's components to be put into the new systems while allowing for the system to be useable to the other existing systems and adding the features that come with the new system.

 An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest environmental impact

 An incremental method would be best for a system that relies on interaction and serves a small audience. This use allows for the best and most direct line of communication with customers on how to improve the system. The incremental updating/fixing would allow for the end users to get a system that does what they needed.
