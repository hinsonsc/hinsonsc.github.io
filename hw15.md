# HW15: Chapter 19

## 19.3) Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?

It isn't possible due to the almost immeasurable complexity the interworkings of said parts could have, for example the 200 components could do 4-5 things by themselves but the interactions between the components could be orders of magnitude higher. Complex systems are not only their components, but all of the interactions and complex relationsips those components have with each other as well as outside sources (such as command line input, local input from other systems and even network input from APIs or cloud services).
