# HW11: Chapter 9

## 9.8) Briefly describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them?

Fault repairs, environmental adaption, and changes of functionality are the three main types of maintenance. Fault repairs are changes to code, design, or requirements thats purpose is to fix errors. Environmental adaption are changes to an existing program or system to allow for a change in the environment that is runs in. Functionality changes are changes made due to a change in requirements of the system. These types are hard to differentiate as they have a lot of overlap and can/do cause each other, so real-life instances of maintenance usually involve more than one.

## 9.10) Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly request it? 

I believe software engineers do have a responsibility to develop code that is maintainable in all situations that they are hired to develop, no matter if it is requested. I believe this because a software engineer should keep the interests of other software engineers in consideration when developing, such as their colleague or even the ones that come behind them to maintain the code they have written. Creating code that isn't maintainable can be seen as creating a product with planned obsolescence, as they know the customer must purchase a new product after a period of time to keep the functionalities they paid for.
