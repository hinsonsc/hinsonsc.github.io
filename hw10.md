# Homework 10: Chapter 15

## 15.10) The reuse of software raises a number of copyright and intellectual property issues. If a customer pays a software contractor to develop a system, who has the right to reuse the developed code? Does the software contractor have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic component? What payment mechanisms might be used to reimburse providers of reusable components? Discuss these issues and other ethical issues associated with the reuse of software.

I believe the full rights of the code, unless specificied in the contract, to the customer. I believe this as they are the person purchasing the code from the software contractor, that purchase isn't just buying code, but it is also buying the ownership rights of the code (unless the contract states otherwise as stated before). I believe a contractor should negotiate the terms of the contract if they want to retain partial/full rights to any of the code they wrote for the customer. If the product uses systems/subprograms that are owned by the contractor or by another party before the creation of the product, they should retain all rights to those systems/subprograms.
