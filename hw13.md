# HW13: Chapter 17

## 17.10) Your company wishes to move from using desktop applications to accessing the same functionality remotely as services. Identify three risks that might arise and suggest how these risks may be reduced.

Security: as more assests and connections are introduced into a system, more points of failure for security are added. New threat vectors can arise from new components of the system such as the remote connections, the remote host, etc. The best way to protect a distributed system is through well implemented authentication on all end-point systems, verification measures for software and connections, and encryption of all traffic in the system.

Failure: For the same reason security gets more complex the more distributed a system, adding more assets/connections will add more ways a system can fail. Systems must implement fault tolerance, thorough logging to allow for engineers to quicky identify issues and fix them, and redundancy of the system itself are a few ways to reduce the risk of total failure.

Complexity: as a system becomes more distributed, the functions of that system almost neccesarily become more complicated as the system requires more redundancy, more security, and more reporting to keep the same functionality of a less-distributed system. This complexity can obfuscate the functions of the system from the users and other engineers, which can make the system much less maintainable. One way to combat the complexity is to make the system as maintainable as possible through documentation, cohesive components, and removal of unused/unneeded components.
