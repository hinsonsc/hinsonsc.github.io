# HW20: Team Progress 2

As I stated in my previous progress report, Cormac and I have stepped up and allowed for Robert's work load to drop significantly. We have completed our mutation testing/fault injects, which means we are completely done on the technical side of things. All we need to do now is polish up, throw our reports together, and create a presentation for the project. As a whole, I feel we enjoyed the project and learned a lot. I feel having Robert on the team was a blessing as his knowledge of the project let us skip the "lets figure out how this thing works" phase, so our project switch left us ahead of the curve rather than behind.
