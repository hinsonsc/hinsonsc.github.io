# Homework 9: Chapter 8 and reflections

## 8.7) Write a scenario that could be used to help design tests for the wilderness weather station system.

One way a weather station system can be tested by using weather data collected manually and cross-referencing them with the data that was gathered by the system. This way any calibrations/changes could be made so that the system reports the same as a person being stationed and ordered to collect weather data. This would need to be done over multiple seperate days/weather situations so ensure the system is correct

## 8.10) A common approach to system testing is to test the more important functionalities of a system first, followed by the less important functionalities until the testing budget is exhausted. Discuss the ethics involved in identifying what “more important” means

"Most important" would mean the functionalities that are required by the client or are dependancies for said required functionalities. Ethically, you would want all parts of the product to be functional to reflect well on software engineering, but a product with the main functionalities not working is much worse to present ethically than a product that has those main functionalities without the non-functional requires such as a "nice looking UI" being tested and implemented.

## Reflections:

Testing is, without a doubt, one of the most important aspects of the software engineering process. All products must be well tested and fixed with those tests to avoid errors, some of which could have fatal consequences. If products are released without testing, any individual or company could be irreparably harmed and if the product is an important aspect of a governmental infrastructure, it could cause the halting or breaking of critical functions of a government. Engineers who do not test their code are directly harming the field of software engineering and pose a threat to the users and clients as well, thus testing must be done to keep up with the ethics of software engineering
